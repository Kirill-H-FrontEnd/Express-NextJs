                  Express.ts is a React framework for building full-stack web
                  applications. You use React Components to build user
                  interfaces, and Express.ts for additional features and
                  optimizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under the hood, Express.ts also abstracts and automatically
                  configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling,
                  and more. This allows you to focus on building your
                  application instead of spending time with configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger
                  team, Express.ts can help you build interactive, dynamic, and
                  fast React applications.

                  The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic
                  to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building
                  your application. However, you can read them in any order or
                  skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

                  Next.js has two different routers: the App Router and the
                  Pages Router. The App Router is a newer router that allows you
                  to use React's latest features, such as Server Components and
                  Streaming. The Pages Router is the original Next.js router,
                  which allowed you to build server-rendered React applications
                  and continues to be supported for older Next.js applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that
                  allows you to switch between the <strong>App Router</strong>{" "}
                  and the <strong>Pages Router</strong> features. Since there
                  are features that are unique to each directory, it's important
                  to keep track of which tab is selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The breadcrumbs at the top of the page will also indicate
                  whether you're viewing App Router docs or Pages Router docs.

                  Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we
                  need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused
                  on Next.js functionality. We'll make sure to provide links to
                  relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.

                  To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you
